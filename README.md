## Challenges & Afterthought

I understand that I suppose to start with a fully finished Html file, but I started with completing my 'heading' section. 
1. I was stuck there for those 3 'li' tags, was trying to make them horizonal. (using 'overflow:auto' sloved the problems)

2. Was having hard time to make my page vertically aline. (by creating a 'div' to include heading contents toger then put them on top of the 'header', this way it shows the result I was looking for)

3. On the 'Portfolio' page, I was using 'img' tag to create these pics at first. Later on, I realized that making boxes is a much better way to do this, because I can use 'position' in css to create banners for my 'boxes/pics'.

It was a very fun with some stucking time duing this project, I am glad I sign up this class and trying to learn something complete new to me whice making this even more fun & challenge.
Even though I finished this project, but I can't say that I understand 100% of everything. I guess time will help me digest.
